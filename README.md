# speedtester-python
*A python script to test your speed and log it. Nothing more.*

A few things that you will need:
1. python (to make everything work)
2. speedtest-cli (to make the speed testing part work)

To install speedtest-cli, do what you do to install any python package. For example, `pip install speedtest-cli' would work.

To run the script, navigate to the script directory (~\speedtester) and run `python speedtester.py`.
