# speedtester-python
*A python script to test your speed and log it. Nothing more.*

A few things that you will need:
1. python (to make everything work)
2. pyspeedtest (to make the speed testing part work)

To install pyspeedtest, do what you do to install any python package. For example,
```python
pip install pyspeedtest
```

To run the script, navigate to the script directory (~\SpeedTester) and run `python speedtester.py`
